- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitMicheal
- 👀 I’m interested in python and how it can be used in Engineering and Energy contexts. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Python to predict failures and to analyse data from other areas. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on energy related topics to help better understand how energy data can be used to reduce energy use. 
- 📫 How to reach me is TBC!
